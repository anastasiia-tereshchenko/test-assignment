## Hi there :wave:

For my test assignment at Yolo Group's Bombay Live Product, I have developed two simple automated tests using Cypress.io. As a Manual QA Engineer, this was my first attempt at writing automated tests  ~(that anybody else except myself will ever see)~, and I really enjoyed the learning experience.

In my first test, I checked the case that brings the joy of generating a username and joining the game. It ensures that users can effortlessly log in and dive into the gaming world :spades:

In my second test, I made sure to check if the system handles those "oops moments" gracefully. By intentionally entering an invalid nickname, I verified that an error message pops up, giving users a friendly heads-up :x:

Now, let's be honest, my autotests aren't perfectâ€”yet! But I'm bursting with enthusiasm to join the team and continue developing my skills ðŸš€

Looking forward to bringing my passion and dedication to the project. Can't wait to contribute to the team's success! ðŸŽ‰
